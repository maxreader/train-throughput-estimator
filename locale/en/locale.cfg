tte-selection-mode=Selection mode

[mod-setting-description]
tte-selection-mode=Whether a selection counts all rolling stock entities as part of a single train, or counts each separate train in its entirety

[shortcut-name]
tte_shortcut=Train throughput estimator selection tool

train-consist-tooltip=The counts of each carriage in the train
max-speed-tooltip=The speed this train will eventually reach given enough time to accelerate
braking-distance-tooltip=The distance this train needs to stop when traveling at maximum speed
sat-throughput-tooltip=How many wagons will pass through a point on the track in the selected time interval, when the train is traveling at maximum speed
wpm-tooltip=The number of wagons that will pass through an intersection of the specified size in the selected time, when each train is starting from a complete halt, and only one train is allowed in the intersection at once
ispm-tooltip=Wagons, but converted to item stacks
